The Image Mastering Application Programming Interface, or IMAPI, is a component of Microsoft Windows operating system used for CD and DVD authoring and recording.
IMAPI provides the ability to create and burn single-session and multi-session discs, including bootable discs. It also provides low-level access to the burn engine for developing support for new devices, as well as access to extended recorder properties.
IMAPI was originally introduced with Windows XP. IMAPI version 2.0 was released with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Current version of IMAPI supports Recordable Blu-ray Disc (BD-R) and Rewritable Blu-ray Disc (BD-RE) media.
More information is available on MSDN and Wikipedia.
Is there anyway to dectect available DVD burners in a windows system using c++? I know how to detect all available drives but I would like to be able to detect which ones have the ability to burn DVD media.
