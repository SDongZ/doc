隐藏SSID没有意义？
netsh wlan show networks mode=bssid

inSSIDer began as a replacement for NetStumbler, a popular Windows Wi-Fi scanner, which had not been actively developed for several years and reputedly did not work with modern 64-bit operating systems or versions of Windows higher than Windows XP. The project was inspired by Charles Putney on The Code Project

最好的JSON解析器
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/245973/whats-the-best-c-json-parser
JsonCpp (http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/)
json_spirit::write( root, json_spirit::pretty_print );

I'm using JSON Spirit on a project at the moment, I'm impressed with it so far.
Note that it does rely on Boost (if only for headers).
Handy features:
Has Unicode support.
Uses std::vector to hold Arrays which helps interoperability.
Provides a pretty print function (write_formatted).
Has read and write functions for strings and streams.
Note that Objects are also implemented using vector (not map), which means slower access, but it does mean that the order of elements is maintained.

Boost property_tree does not fully support all type information. 
From the documentation: JSON values are mapped to nodes containing the value. 
However, all type information is lost; numbers, as well as the literals "null", "true" and "false" 
are simply mapped to their string form

Packet injection(注入)
By utilizing raw sockets, NDIS function calls, or direct access to a network adapter kernel mode driver, arbitrary packets can be constructed and injected into a computer network. These arbitrary packets can be constructed from any type of packet protocol (ICMP, TCP, UDP, and others) since there is full control over the packet header while the packet is being assembled

The basic service set (BSS) provides the basic building-block of an 802.11 wireless LAN.
Each BSS or ESS is identified by a service set identifier (SSID) - a 1 to 32 byte string

An extended service set (ESS) is a set of two or more interconnected wireless BSSs that share the same SSID (network name), 
security credentials and integrated (providing translation between 802.3 and 802.11 frames) wired local area networks that appear 
as a single BSS to the logical link control layer at any station associated with one of those BSSs 
which facilitates mobile IP and fast secure roaming applications; 
the BSSs may work on the same channel, or work on different channels to boost aggregate throughput.

boost::system::error_code 的类型判断

{
	try {
		//boost::mutex::scoped_lock lock( m_mutex );
		
		if( ec ) {                                          判断这个ERROR是否是，国为串已经关闭
			// 如果出错了，直接读下次的
			m_port.async_read_some( boost::asio::buffer( m_read_buf_raw, SERIAL_PORT_READ_BUF_SIZE), 
				boost::bind( &SerialPort::on_receive_, this, 
					boost::asio::placeholders::error, 
					boost::asio::placeholders::bytes_transferred ) );
			return;
		}


WinaMain 获取传递的参数
MFC也可以像控制台那样获取命令行参数：
利用GetCommandLineW()函数获得命令行参数，
利用CommandLineToArgvW()函数解析命令行参数
LPWSTR *szArglist = NULL;   
int nArgs = 0;   
szArglist = CommandLineToArgvW(GetCommandLineW(), &nArgs);   
if( NULL != szArglist)   
{   
//szArglist就是保存参数的数组   
//nArgs是数组中参数的个数   
//数组的第一个元素表示进程的path，也就是szArglist[0]，其他的元素依次是输入参数。   
}   
//取得参数后，释放CommandLineToArgvW申请的空间   
LocalFree(szArglist);

Overlapped I/O operation

boost::asio::socket 异步读写时  socket关闭问题？需要同步吗？

Using the attached sample program (a slightly modified version of the daytime3 tutorial). When I connect with a telnet session to the server and close the connection directly I get the following output from the server: Transfer status: Success. Transfer status: Broken pipe. Transfer status: Broken pipe. Transfer status: Broken pipe.

After the first error I close the socket and would expect a boost::asio::error::operation_aborted error instead of the broken pipe.

Reproduced under both Debian Lenny (gcc 4.3.4) and Windows XP (MSVC 2008).
当调用close后，正在写的操作，就completed with an error as soon as the client closed the connection
The behaviour is correct. The write operations are not pending when you call close, it's just that the handlers haven't been called yet. The write operations themselves completed with an error as soon as the client closed the connection.

CloseHandle(impl.handle_) 串口，即使只有一个线程，也会死在句。退不出来。USB2PORT
I agree with both previous posts.

This is not a normal situation.
Unplugging the USB device usually helps.
This problem is related to the glitches in the FTDI driver, which is responsible for implementing a virtual COM port. On the other hand those "glitches" are related to various malfunctions of the USB devices. (Of course this doesn't justify the FTDI driver).

BTW there're several other known problems with some FTDI drivers:

Sometimes call to CloseHandle just hangs the calling thread.
Sometimes also the application is still "visible" in the task manager, even after it's closed. Task manager can't terminate the application, and the debugger can't be attached to it. Its EXE file is locked (can't be erased).
Usually unplugging the USB device immediately helps in those situations. The FTDI driver, which seems to be "waiting for something" awakes.

一个boost::asio::socket, 在不同的线程，写，不加互斥，是不安全的。
The only way to protect you from hitting this case is to build your program to avoid situations like this.

One way to do that is by writing an application layer send buffer 
which a single thread is responsible for pushing onto the socket. 
That way you could protect the send buffer itself only. 
Keep in mind though that a simple std::vector won't work, 
since adding bytes to the end may end up re-allocating it, 
possibly while there is an outstanding async_write_some() referencing it. 
Instead, it's probably a good idea to use a linked list of buffers, a
nd make use of the scatter/gather feature of asio.

write and async_write are not thread safe in the manner you are using them. 
The canonical way to approach this is to queue your messages, then write them out one at a time.

Tip::tcp::socket  hread Safety
Distinct objects: Safe.
Shared objects: Unsafe.

boost::socket对象在工作线程中同步读写的情况，在另一线程里关闭？没有常规的办法。
Thread-safely closing a boost::asio::ip::tcp::socket being used synchronously
异步读写的情况下，可以先cancel
If your acceptor is in async_accept, you can call ip::tcp::acceptor::cancel() to cancel any async operations on it. 
试验结果，虽然cancel了，还是会接收到数据（m_serial_port.cancel  m_serial_port.close 那个会再引导异步I/O操作？）

Cancel is useful if you want to stop pending operations without closing down the socket.
Note that the Boost documentation recommends using close for greater portability (from doc page):
... For portable cancellation, consider using one of the following alternatives:
Disable asio's I/O completion port backend by defining BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_IOCP.
Use the close() function to simultaneously cancel the outstanding operations and close the socket.

Note however the remarks for cancel() also state When running on Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and later, the CancelIoEx function is always used. 
This function does not have the problems described above. 
C  Sam Miller Jun 22 '11 at 15:33 
thank you and Sam Miller for help,i understand a little now,thank you

cancel won't close the socket, so use cancel if you intend to continue using the socket object. In particular, if you have code in asynchronous handler methods that references the socket's member functions, you may not want to close the socket until you are guaranteed that your currently executing asynchronous handlers have completed.

cancel doesn't guarantee anything about currently executing asynchronous handlers, it only guarantees (per the boost documentation) that "This function causes all outstanding asynchronous connect, send and receive operations to finish immediately" in the case of the socket::cancel() call, or "This function forces the completion of any pending asynchronous operations on the host resolver" in the case of the resolver::cancel() call. This "completion" means that boost will call your asynchronous handler method, it has no jurisdiction to inject any cancellation logic into your asynchronous handler (not to mention it doesn't know about the handler's implementation to begin with).

I would suggest adding your own logic into your asynchronous handler method to handle the case where the socket/resolver/etc. is canceled. If you are calling the cancel method, then you likely have the ability to communicate this cancellation to the asynchronous handler method.

basic_serial_port::close (1 of 2 overloads)

Close the serial port.

void close();  根据下面的解释，Close前没有必要调用cancel
This function is used to close the serial port. Any asynchronous read or write operations will be cancelled immediately, and will complete with the boost::asio::error::operation_aborted error.

更改编辑框的字体
CWindow::SetFont
Changes the window's current font by sending a WM_SETFONT message to the window.

由StockObject font 创建一个CFont  m_Font.Attach(GetStockObject(DEFAULT_GUI_FONT)); 
stock font size 
CFont *m_pFont = new CFont;
m_pFont->CreateFont(...);
myEdit->SetFont(m_pFont);

GetDlgItem(IDC_EDIT1)->SetFont(&m_editFont);

void makebold(HWND hwnd)
{
	HFONT hFontB,hFont = (HFONT)SendMessage(hwnd,WM_GETFONT,0,0);
	LOGFONT lf;
	GetObject(hFont, sizeof(LOGFONT), &lf);
	lf.lfWeight = FW_BOLD;
	hFontB = CreateFontIndirect(&lf);
	SendMessage(hwnd,WM_SETFONT,(int)hFontB,1);
}

To change the font: WM_SETFONT.
To change the back color: WM_CTLCOLOREDIT.
